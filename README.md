# Bible Heading Trainer

## Todo:

- Headings with same text can be clicked in wrong order (Ok, but when second is wrong the first still blinks)
- Group chapters together
- 1 Peter is not complete (all headings use a h2 equivalent instead of h1)
- Add other heading collections e.g. parts of a book (makes it simpler for learning books with a lot of chapters)
- Wrapping for smaller screens
